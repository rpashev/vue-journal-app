      <h1>What can you write about?</h1>
      <p>
        With practice, you can develop the ability to find inspiration in
        everything you see. But, when you're just getting into journal writing,
        or when you're really stuck, these suggested journal prompts can be very
        helpful. Here are some examples of journal prompts to help you start a
        journal or to inspire a dedicated journal writer:

        your secrets falling into the wrong hands.
